                    <li>The customer is responsible for their own data. We cannot guarantee your data. We strongly recommend you backup all your data before bringing in your computer for service, this insures that you have a backup of data that is important
                        to you.</li>

                    <li>The customer must pickup their computer and/or parts within one week of notification of completion. After one week, the computer and/or parts are subject a $5.00 per day storage fee. If you have not heard from us within five days after
                        you dropped off the system please call us at (253) 627-5960 to check the status. Computers and/or parts left for over 30 days will be sold to offset the bill. Sorry but we do not have the space to store your computers.</li>

                    <li>All computers are subject to a virus scan, unless you specify otherwise. This is because 90% of computers are infected with spyware and/or viruses when they are dropped off. Any spyware related programs will be removed, this often
                        includes: peer-to-peer file sharing programs, video or audio codecs, messaging programs, games and cutesie add-on programs. These programs are often the cause of several problems. Labor is warrantied for 30 days unless you re-infect
                        by installing spyware programs. If your problems reoccur, please call us right away as your computer will probably have to be reloaded to insure a clean and stable system, at no additional labor charge.</li>
